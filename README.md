# Rust Tutorial 2020

Repository of code and slides for RUShanghaiTech x [Geek Pie](https://github.com/ShanghaitechGeekPie) Rust tutorial series 2020.

## Why having this talk?

In Rust [survey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/04/17/Rust-survey-2019.html) 2019: (rephrased)

> People are asking for more beginner and intermediate level learning material about Rust, a lot of which asked for video content specifically.

This tutorial series aims to give a thorough introduction to Rust, not just an overview of the language.

This tutorial is suitable for those who have basic knowledge about at least one language in Python/C/C++. It is primarily designed for [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) students.

## Resources

The code presented in each lecture resides in `/lec\d+/` folder. 

The source code of the slides resides in the `slides` folder.
To view the slides locally, you may start a simple http server (at the `slides`) folder with python:
```bash
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then open you browser and go to [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Videos (in Chinese) will be recorded & uploaded onto Bilibili after each talk.
